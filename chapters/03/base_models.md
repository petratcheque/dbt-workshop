# Base models - `base_[sourcename]_[tablename].sql`

Base models are stored in **staging/[sourcename]/base** folder. No transformation are performed in this stage, only renaming or recasting of columns. 

:::{admonition} Use `{{ source() }}` function
    
üí° Select from source tables in your models using the `{{ source() }}` function, which is helping define the lineage of your data. 

 ```
 select * from {{ source(source_name, table_name) }}
 ```

Values for each data source are defined in `_src_[sourcename].yml` which was done [in the previous step](../02/data_sources.md).

* `source_name`: The `name:` defined under a `sources:` key
* `table_name`: The `name:` defined under a `tables:` key
